# Decentralized P2P Travel Marketplace

### Project Overview
DivvyTrek is a blockchain-powered ecosystem focused on revolutionizing the travel industry. It provides an end-to-end peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace for the short-term rental and hospitality industries, enabling secure, frictionless transactions between travelers, service providers, and merchants. DivvyTrek uses cryptocurrency and smart contracts to remove the inefficiencies in traditional booking systems, reducing transaction costs and offering a decentralized, trustless solution for the travel market.

### Key Features
- Blockchain-Powered Platform: Built on Ethereum, allowing decentralized and tamper-resistant transactions.
- Smart Contracts: Automated contracts that facilitate booking and payments between travelers, merchants, and service providers without intermediaries.
- Cryptocurrency Payments: Uses Divvy Token (DIVVY) for transactions, eliminating high merchant processing fees and providing a seamless cross-border payment solution.
- End-to-End Guest Management: Covers everything from booking and payments to concierge services and customer support, all under one integrated platform.
- Global Reach: Focused on markets with high cryptocurrency adoption, starting with the Asia-Pacific region.
